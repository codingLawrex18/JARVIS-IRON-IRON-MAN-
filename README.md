Tony Stark designed a natural language user interface program which he named J.A.R.V.I.S., after his late butler, Edwin Jarvis.
Over the years, Stark improved and perfected the system, adding security protocols and eventually upgrading the U.I. into an A.I. system. 
Now artificially intelligent and programmed to aid Tony Stark.
J.A.R.V.I.S. was tasked with operating Stark's mansion as well as handling business for Stark Industries.
